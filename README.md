This project gives an opportunity to apply the skills from  'Data Manipulation with pandas' and 'and Merging DataFrames with pandas' courses from 'Data Scientist with Python' specialization. (https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=4).


Open source projects contain entire development histories - who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. This project involves read in, clean up, and visualization of the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. This project involves the analysis regarding who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.
